# Yugioh-Script-Generator-Advanced
In brief, a mini program that creates .lua files for a gaming platform for a specific game, as if AI was used.



One of the platforms used to play Yugioh (a card game) is EDOPro, also known as YGOPro. It makes use of .lua scripts, each one representing one card and utilizing its "effects". 
There are three (technically only two) ways to create/write the scripts:
1. Manually, by individuals.
2. Manually but collaboratively, by groups of people who support the platform.
3. Automatically by using an app.

There are extremely few apps about it that I know of. One of them is my own, ScriptGeneratorYGO, which can be found here: https://github.com/ManolisPy/ScriptGeneratorYGO
I worked on that mostly as my graduate project and has remained very basic since. It makes use of dictionaries and ready parts of code commonly seen in the actual scripts, instead of a more... sophisticated way like here.

The idea is to simply write a card's "effect" (text), then the program "reads" it and creates the .lua file automatically. Not in demo version anymore but still minimal at the moment; just a small drop-down menu, a text box and two ready example effects to work with. The user selects one of the two and the corresponding text appears in the text box. Then, they click a button and voila! file created.

The zipped file contains an executable with the necessary stuff for it to run. The app is easy to use and the instructions are clear. I don't think the modules matter (despite having uploaded them), because my intention is merely to introduce the concept.
You will find the executable and a zipped file with itself & its dependencies, both made with Pyinstaller. The modules are also uploaded, separately.
